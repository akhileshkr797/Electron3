    <h3>Electron Practice</h3>
    <p>
        First, we are setting the width and height to arbitrary numbers – your typical size of 320 by 240 pixels. These numbers may change depending on the design of the content you may be placing inside your splash window. For now, since our splash window will
        be basically blank, we’ll go with this size. The next property, frame, is the property that sets the frame around the window. For our styling purposes, we’re going to set frame to false so there will not be a border around our splash window. The
        resizable property controls whether the user can resize our splash window. Combined with having no frame, this is a visual indication to the user that this window doesn’t expect any interaction. Finally, we have the alwaysOnTop and show properties.
        We want the splash window to appear above all of our other windows, so we need alwaysOnTop to be set to true. If we did not use the alwaysOnTop setting, or if we set it to false, the next window we created would appear over our splash window.
        Setting the show property to false gives us the ability to display our splash window once it is ready. Later in this method we use the ‘ready-to-show’ event to show our splash window.

        <h3>Electron Sample Project</h3>
        <p id="p02">GitHub Electron (or simply Electron) allows you to build desktop applications using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sounds like a pretty ambitious statement to make. But it is indeed true, just as Apache Cordova (also known as PhoneGap) enables
            you to create mobile applications also with just HTML, CSS, JS, and so does Electron for the desktop.<br> Originally released in July 2013 by Cheng Zhao, an engineer at Github, it was part of their effort to produce a new code editor, Atom.
            Initially, the project was known as the Atom Shell but was soon rebranded simply as Electron. Although other solutions existed, this project quickly gained traction within the development community. In fact, Adobe AIR, released back in 2008,
            originally supported building desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in addition to ActionScript. So the desire to leverage web technologies beyond the browser is certainly not a new one.<br> In this book, we will take you through
            the entire Electron ecosystem from its initial setup, through its key features, like creating native menus and windows and more, and how to deploy our app so it can be distributed to our users. Rather bog you down in understanding some abstract
            sample applications, we are going to be focusing on the core code needing to make Electron work. So, you don't need to know the latest framework to use Electron, but having some basic knowledge with Node.js is useful.
